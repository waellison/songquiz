Version 0.1 "Knee-Deep in the Sound"

A music quiz program thingee written in Python.

I created this as a project during my Nucamp course in CS fundamentals with Python.

You can select from four difficulty levels, which affect the number of lines of lyrics shown:

* Easy: "I'm Too Young to Sing"
* Medium: "Arpeggiate Me Plenty"
* Hard: "Ultra-Harmony"
* Evil: "Nightmare!"

(No, the Doom-flavored difficulty names are not in the final build.)

Song lyrics are the intellectual property of the people who own them and are used here as sample data.

Requires the `tr` library; run `pip install python-tr` before running `songquiz.py`.
