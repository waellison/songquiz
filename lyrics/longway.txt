Ridin' down the highway, goin' to a show
Stop in all the byways, playin' rock n' roll
Gettin' robbed, gettin' stoned
Gettin' beat up, broken-boned
Gettin' had, gettin' took
I tell you folks, it's harder than it looks
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n' roll
If you think it's easy doin' one-night stands
Try playin' in a rock-roll band
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n' roll
Hotel, motel, make you wanna cry
Ladies do the hard sell, know the reason why
Gettin' old, gettin' grey
Gettin' ripped off, underpaid
Gettin' sold, secondhand
That's how it goes, playin' in a band
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n' roll
If you wanna be a star of stage and screen
Look out, it's rough and mean!
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n' roll
It's a long way to the top if you wanna rock n' roll
