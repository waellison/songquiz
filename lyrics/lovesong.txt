Head underwater, and they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
Breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me, it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold on to
Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you tell me it's
Make or breaking this
If you're on your way, I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song
Today, today, yeah
I learned the hard way that they all say
Things you want to hear
My heavy heart sinks deep down under
You and your twisted words, your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry
Convince me to please you, make me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song 'cause you tell me it's
Make or breaking this
If you're on your way, I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song
Today
Promise me you'll leave the light on
To help me see with daylight, my guide, gone
'Cause I believe there's a way you can love me because I say
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one,
You see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or breaking this
Is that why you wanted a love song?
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's Make or breaking this
Or you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it, I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas when I believe that
There's a reason to write you a love song
Today, today
